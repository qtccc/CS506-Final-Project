# CS506-Final-Project

Description of the project : The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts flight delays using weather data. Flight delays are a common issue, and accurate predictions can help airlines, passengers, and airports manage time and resources more efficiently.



Goals : Our goal is to predict delays for upcoming flights due to weather conditions.



Data needed :
- Collect historical flight data on departure/arrival airports, duration of delay, etc.
- Collect past weather data on temperature, precipitation, wind speed, visibility, and other relevant weather variables.


Data Collection Modeling :
